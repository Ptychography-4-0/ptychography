# About

This is a prototype for creating a python binding for alpaka with pybind11. The prototype is divided into 3 steps. Each step increase the complexity and requirements of it predecessor.

* **simple_cpp** Create a python binding for pure C++ code.
* **simple_cuda** Create a python binding for CUDA C++ code.
* **alpaka** Create a python binding for C++ code with the Alpaka library and the CUDA backend

# Environment

The [Requirements](Requirements.md) contains instructions to setup the environment.
