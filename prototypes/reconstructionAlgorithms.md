# Ptychographical reconstruction algorithms

## Existing reconstruction approaches for ptychography:

- iterative, e.g. EPIE (widely used)
- Wigner deconvolution (blind deconvolution)
- Wirtinger Flow
- Phase Lift. Solve system of linear equations

## Special cases:
- ptycho tomography
- multiple wavelength: suitable approach?

## Questions
- applicability and limitations of the algorithms?
- speed?
- parallelizable?
- scalable implementation?
- accuracy?
- robustness to noise?
- convergence to correct / unique solution?
- applicability to interactive measurements ("online reconstruction")?
- data formats? HDF5?
- zeroMQ,..?
